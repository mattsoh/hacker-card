# Matthew's PCB Hacker Card

Hi everyone! I've made an NFC card that would basically act as a resume for myself. It's simply an NFC card on a PCB, with an antenna and an NFC chip.

I made this project after seeing so many other Hack Clubbers have similar Hacker Cards that I didn't have, so I finally decided to make a Hacker Card. I'm also really bad at hardware, so it was nice to make something that hopefully will actually work.
