# The Journal

Date (all of the project): July 9 - July 10, 2025
Total time spent: 10.5 hours

## 1. Making the circuit diagram - 7 hours

This part was surprisingly complicated, as I had to create my EasyEDA account and learn how all the components of the card worked!

## 2. Converting to a PCB (or whatever you convert it) - 20 mins

Took some time finding the button!

## 3. Rearranging and auto-routing the PCB - 2 hours

Not easy... apparently the other stuff shouldn't be in the antenna or something else like that. I also tried to autoroute and that failed, and so I had to rearrange a lot of other stuff.

## 4. Finishing touches! - 10 mins

Simply adding the text and I'm done!
